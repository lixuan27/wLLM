"""wLLM — Motus AttentionSpec factory (RTX, sm120) — G1 stub.

Motus has THREE distinct attention sites in the denoise loop:

    1. ``mot_joint``  Tri-model self-attention. Each layer concatenates
                      Q/K/V from {video, action, und} experts (each
                      expert projects from its own native hidden dim
                      onto a shared head_dim=128) and runs a single
                      MHA over the unified sequence. NUM_Q_HEADS varies
                      per expert; the joint site uses NUM_Q_HEADS = 24
                      (Wan native) and KV is broadcast / GQA-style.
                      30 layers × 1 site.

    2. ``wan_cross``  Wan video tokens cross-attend to T5 text context
                      (umt5-xxl, 512 padded tokens). Only the video
                      expert participates; action / und do not. KV is
                      computed once per call from T5 ctx and CACHED for
                      the whole 10-step denoise loop. 30 layers × 1 site.

    3. ``vlm_qwen3``  Qwen3-VL internal attention (the frozen VLM that
                      produces Und tokens). At G2 we will likely run
                      the VLM in PyTorch outside the wLLM graph (one
                      forward per call, then cache und_tokens), so this
                      site is reserved for a future "VLM inside graph"
                      optimization. 28 layers (Qwen3-VL-2B depth).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
G1 status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The factory returns a SiteSpec layout that is import-safe but is
NOT YET tuned for actual shapes — `max_q_seq` / `max_kv_seq` are set
to conservative upper bounds to allow buffer allocation in G2 without
re-deriving formulas. G2 will tighten them based on the actual
post-G0 measurements.

Conservative upper bounds chosen:
    video tokens     S_v = T_l * H'/2 * W'/2 = 3 * 12 * 10 = 360
    action tokens    S_a = action_chunk + state(0) + reg(0) = 8
    und tokens       S_u ≤ 256  (Qwen3-VL last-layer; image grid + text
                                  prompt — actual measured at runtime)
    joint Sq_total  ≤ 360 + 8 + 256 = 624
    T5 ctx          = 512  (fixed by Wan text_len)
    Sq_qwen3        ≤ 256  (Qwen3-VL prompt+image)
