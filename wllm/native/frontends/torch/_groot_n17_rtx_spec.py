"""wLLM -- GROOT N1.7 weight spec for the RTX torch frontend.

The N1.7 checkpoint tensor layout is hardware-independent.  Keep an RTX
module entry point so the frontend can depend on an RTX-named spec without
importing Thor frontend code, while reusing the single declarative spec that
already covers all N1.7 safetensors keys.
