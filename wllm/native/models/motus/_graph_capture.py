"""G5 — CUDA Graph capture of the Motus denoise pipeline.

After all G3a-G4 swaps are installed and FP8 calibration is done, the
hot path is fully fvk-driven (norm + GEMM + attention + FFN + bias),
but each forward issues ~6000 pybind crossings per call. Even though
each kernel itself is fast, the per-launch CPU work ends up dominating.

CUDA Graph capture collapses the entire denoise loop (10 steps × 30
layers × N kernels each) into a single graph that replays with one
launch. Per-call cost drops from ~1037 ms (G4) to whatever the GPU
needs to actually compute the work.

Caveats / approach:
    1. PyTorch's torch.cuda.graph(...) requires CUDA ops to run on
       the capture stream. The fvk wrappers were updated in this gate
       to pass torch.cuda.current_stream().cuda_stream via
       wllm_native.models.motus._stream.cs(), which returns the right
       stream both inside and outside capture.
    2. Per-call inputs (first_frame, state) are copied into FIXED
       device buffers BEFORE replay. The graph reads from these
       same addresses on every replay.
    3. T5 ctx + VLM und_tokens are computed ONCE per set_prompt and
       stored on the pipeline as cached device tensors; the captured
       graph's wan-cross/und-attention paths read from these fixed
       addresses (no re-VLM per step inside graph).
    4. Random noise: torch.randn(...) inside the captured forward
       runs ONCE at capture time and produces the same bytes on
       every replay. This means the seed used at capture is "frozen"
       for all subsequent calls. Fine for our deterministic-test use
       case; will revisit for true production noise later.
    5. The output tensors are aliases into the captured mempool —
       must be cloned before being returned to the user, otherwise
       the next replay overwrites them.

Lifecycle:
    set_prompt(prompt, t5, vlm) -> pre-encode T5 + VLM tokens, store
        on pipeline (calls before infer; safe to repeat).
    infer #1 -> calibration (G4) on uncaptured eager path.
    infer #2 -> capture pass: warmup + torch.cuda.graph(...).
    infer #3+ -> replay only.

Or with explicit warmup helper:
    frontend.warmup_graph(sample_first_frame, sample_state)  # does #1+#2
    frontend.infer(...)  # straight to replay
