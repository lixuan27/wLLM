"""Binding-name regression net for the generic-kernel-helper cleanup (#112)
and the slim-build source gating (Units 1-3).

This guards the ownership cleanup that moves model-neutral helpers out of
Qwen3.6-named files into neutral files, and stays correct under both build
modes. The contract is:

- Neutral binding names (``bf16_matmul_bf16``, ``embedding_lookup_bf16``) MUST
  exist in EVERY build mode: they live in always-compiled neutral TUs, so the
  slim gate never removes them. Existing call sites and external users rely on
  them.
- Legacy binding names (``bf16_matmul_qwen36_bf16``,
  ``qwen36_embedding_lookup_bf16``) live inside Qwen3.6 TUs gated behind
  ``WLLM_HAVE_QWEN36_KERNELS``. In the compat default build they MUST exist;
  in a slim build (WLLM_SLIM_BUILD=ON) they are intentionally gated out, so
  the test must NOT require them there.

Because these assertions run against the imported ``.so`` (not a build dir), we
detect the build mode from the module itself: a sentinel Qwen3.6 symbol that is
gated under the same ``WLLM_HAVE_QWEN36_KERNELS`` macro as the legacy
bindings. If the sentinel is absent, this is a slim build and the legacy names
are expected to be absent too.

These are CPU/import-friendly: importing the compiled ``.so`` does not require
a CUDA device or any model checkpoint, only that the extension built.
