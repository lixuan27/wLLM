# wLLM PR Review Checklist

This checklist is the public maintenance standard for wLLM pull requests.
It is intentionally strict because wLLM is a multi-model, multi-framework,
multi-hardware runtime. Reviewers should optimize for long-term correctness,
clear ownership, and incremental development over short-term benchmark wins.

The core contract is:

- predictable low-latency inference
- explicit hardware and model routing
- stable public APIs
- incremental changes over broad rewrites
- thin Python glue composing C++/CUDA kernels
- clean frontend, model pipeline, hardware, and serving boundaries
- opt-in feature gates for model-specific kernels
- clear failure modes instead of silent fallback
- no private paths, local environment assumptions, generated traces, or stale
  benchmark claims

## 1. Review Verdicts

Use one of these outcomes:

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Accept | Correct, isolated, documented, and tested enough for the risk | Merge |
| Accept after small cleanup | Only wording, comments, stale doc text, or harmless cleanup remains | Ask for cleanup or patch directly |
| Request changes | API mismatch, failing test, unclear build gate, wrong docs, or unsupported fallback | Block merge until fixed |
| Blocker | Existing path can break, math is wrong, symbols are missing, private data leaked, or behavior is unsafe | Must fix before merge |
| Needs hardware validation | Code is structurally right but touches hardware or precision paths not validated by reviewer | Require contributor or CI evidence |

Do not merge a PR with a known blocker because the diff is small.

## 2. Risk Classification

Classify the PR before reviewing implementation details.

| Risk | Typical PR | Minimum review posture |
|---|---|---|
| R0 | Docs typo, comment-only update, dead test cleanup | Check diff and links |
| R1 | Local bug fix in one non-hot file | Focused test and import check |
| R2 | New opt-in frontend/model path, isolated docs/tests | Build/import where relevant plus correctness evidence |
| R3 | CMake, binding, kernel, calibration, graph, cache, or dispatch change | Full affected-path review plus old-path regression evidence |
| R4 | Public API, shared runtime refactor, default behavior, multi-hardware routing, serving/exec contract | Require design clarity, tests, docs, and rollback path |

The stricter checklist applies if the PR touches any of:

- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `csrc/`
- `wllm_native/api.py`
- `wllm_native/hardware/`
- `wllm_native/frontends/`
- `wllm_native/models/`
- `serving/`
- calibration, cache, CUDA Graph, dispatch, or precision code

## 3. Basic Review Commands

Use a temporary worktree rather than a developer's active checkout.

```bash
PR=<number>
REPO=wllm-project/wLLM
ROOT=<repo-root>
WT=<temporary-worktree>

git -C "$ROOT" fetch origin main pull/${PR}/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr${PR}-head --force
rm -rf "$WT"
git -C "$ROOT" worktree prune
git -C "$ROOT" worktree add "$WT" origin/pr${PR}-head
cd "$WT"

gh pr view "$PR" --repo "$REPO" \
  --json title,author,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,mergeable,isDraft,url,additions,deletions,changedFiles,body

git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
git diff --name-status origin/main...HEAD
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
git diff --check origin/main...HEAD
```

Ask for a rebase when the PR changes the same ownership area as recent main:
CMake targets, binding lists, frontend/pipeline files, kernels, generated
artifacts, or performance-sensitive dispatch code.

## 4. Scope And Isolation

Required:

- The PR title and body must match the actual diff.
- A PR should have one primary reason to exist: one bug fix, one model path,
  one hardware path, one precision path, one serving host, or one refactor.
- New feature code should be additive unless the PR is explicitly a refactor.
- Existing behavior should remain unchanged when the new flag, route, model, or
  hardware target is not selected.
- Shared helper changes require a call-site inventory and old-path evidence.
- Hardware-specific changes must stay under explicit hardware routing.
- Model-specific changes must not be placed in generic helpers unless they are
  truly model-agnostic.

Blockers:

- A model PR changes unrelated models.
- A hardware PR changes shared dispatch without proving old hardware paths.
- A precision PR changes default dtype selection for unrelated paths.
- A "cleanup" PR changes launch order, dtype, shape semantics, cache semantics,
  or public behavior.
- A feature is enabled by default but validated on only one model or machine.
- The PR mixes unrelated model kernels into a bug fix or shared runtime change.

## 5. Repository Layering

Keep responsibilities in their owner layer.

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `csrc/` | C++/CUDA kernels, launch wrappers, pybind ABI, vendor kernel adapters | model routing, prompts, checkpoint names, serving policy |
| `exec/` | C ABI replay mechanism: Buffer, Graph, Plan, Event, ShapeKey; graph-cache mechanism (evict/count) | sessions, schedulers, KV semantics, protocol fields, model policy, eviction policy |
| `runtime/` | frozen hand-off ABI: `frt_runtime_export_v1` + `frt_model_runtime_v1` (ports, stage DAG, verbs), builder, identity/fingerprint rule | model transforms, modality processing, scheduling, anything model-named |
| `cpp/` | native model-runtime implementations: modality primitives, family contracts, per-model adapters presenting the generic face | new public ABI surfaces (the struct in `runtime/` is the only deployment surface) |
| `wllm_native/hardware/` | arch detection, attention backend factories, hardware-generic primitives | model-specific decoder logic or checkpoint-specific shapes |
| `wllm_native/models/<model>/` | per-model compute pipeline and model-local helpers | public root exports, serving protocol, unrelated shared utilities |
| `wllm_native/frontends/<framework>/` | IO path, weight loading, calibration, buffer allocation, graph capture | low-level kernel implementations, cross-model policy |
| `serving/` | scenario hosts, sessions, protocols, request policy | kernel implementation, default core imports, common execution policy |
| `training/` | training and finetuning paths | inference hot-path dependencies unless explicitly shared and tested |

For a model-runtime capability change, require all of the following:

- the released prefix, verbs size/offsets, enum values and ABI version remain
  exact; each additive tail/table has its own required-size probe;
- an independently compiled baseline-prefix producer and a tail-aware consumer
  prove no out-of-bounds tail read;
- extension IDs and canonical identity records are assigned in core, contain no
  provider/model/backend names, and are emitted only by the common builder;
- authority XOR, malformed/unknown table, owner retention, override forwarding,
  metadata restrictions and fingerprint change/no-change matrices are tested;
- OPAQUE execution does not silently acquire graph hot-path, async, cancellation
  or model-state guarantees that its table does not declare.

Blockers:

- A frontend imports a serving host or server-only dependency.
- A model pipeline imports FastAPI, datasets, training packages, notebooks, CLI
  parsing, or benchmark harness code.
- A generic hardware helper contains tensor names, layer counts, prompt rules,
  or checkpoint keys from one model.
- `exec/` gains a field or verb whose meaning is specific to one model family,
  protocol, session policy, scheduler policy, or KV-cache policy.
- `runtime/` gains a model-named field, a scenario verb, or a non-additive
  struct change; a consumer requires the latest full
  `sizeof(frt_model_runtime_v1)` instead of `FRT_MODEL_RUNTIME_V1_BASE_SIZE`;
  or a port is declared `STAGED` without a working input `set_input` / output
  `get_output` hot verb (advertise-and-refuse).
- A hot-path verb (`set_input`/`get_output`, SWAP writes, tick) allocates,
  recaptures, or rebinds graph pointers.

## 6. Public API And Import Boundaries

Required:

- Stable APIs must match `docs/stable_api.md`.
- Model-specific helper APIs should live under `wllm_native.models.<model>` or a
  framework-specific frontend module, not the `wllm_native` root.
- Optional model packages must be lazy imported.
- `import wllm_native` must not require optional model, server, eval, training, or
  checkpoint dependencies.
- Importing a model package should ideally succeed without the external model
  package; runtime entry points can fail clearly when called.
- New dependencies must land in the narrowest optional extra.
- Environment variables are allowed only for explicit opt-in behavior,
  diagnostics, or temporary compatibility, and must be documented.

Blockers:

- `import wllm_native` fails without an optional dependency.
- Core install starts requiring heavy optional packages.
- Tests assert an API path that implementation does not expose.
- Docs show a root import for a model-specific API that is not exported there.
- A missing optional `.so` triggers an unclear low-level error instead of a
  clear `RuntimeError` or equivalent fail-fast message.

Minimum checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python - <<'PY'
import wllm_native
print("wllm_native import ok")
PY

PYTHONPATH=. python - <<'PY'
import importlib
m = importlib.import_module("wllm_native.models.<model>")
print("model package import ok", m)
PY
```

## 7. CMake, Binding, And Module Ownership

Every pybind symbol must have matching build ownership.

Required:

- Feature-specific modules should be behind explicit CMake flags.
- Default `wllm_native_kernels` must not compile model-specific kernels unless
  those kernels are truly shared.
- Vendor-, architecture-, and precision-specific sources must be gated at the
  object-library or target level, not only at runtime.
- Gated `.cu` sources must not be referenced by unconditional pybind entries.
- Dedicated modules are preferred for large model-specific kernel groups:
  `wllm_native_<model>_kernels`, `wllm_native_<feature>`, or similar.
- A new CMake flag must have a clear default, status message, target ownership,
  and docs entry.
- Architecture labels and CMake feature flags must be consistent with runtime
  hardware detection and routing.
- Native C++ model producers must be absent from the default build. Require a
  three-level umbrella, model and hardware-target gate; enabling only the
  umbrella must not compile model sources or tests.
- A native producer shared library must use hidden visibility and an exact C
  API export allowlist; check the complete set, not only symbol presence.
- A native model PR must show that existing common `csrc` files are unchanged
  from the base revision. Native-only operation gaps may live under
  `csrc/native_cpp/` only when they are model-independent and opt-in.
- Each native-only operation must identify the missing common contract
  dimension. Reject shadow implementations when an existing operation already
  satisfies the call site, especially copies that differ only in rounding or
  reduction details.
- Numerical parity evidence must use the unchanged current producer as the
  reference. A frozen producer built from the same modified operation sources
  is useful for refactor regression, but is not an independent parity oracle.

Blockers:

- Undefined symbol at import time.
- Duplicate symbol at link time.
- CMake flag says OFF by default but sources still enter the default target.
- Architecture-specific kernels compile into unsupported architecture targets.
- Vendor-specific compile options leak into generic targets without a gate.
- Binding list and required-symbol list are not updated together.
- Internal CUDA/C++/vendor symbols leak from a native producer shared library.
- Enabling a native target changes the default Python module's math, link
  ownership, dynamic dependencies or install unit.
- A model adaptation changes an existing common operation's signature,
  numerical behavior or workspace contract instead of isolating the need.

Build checks:

```bash
cmake -S . -B <build-dir> -DGPU_ARCH=<target_arch> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build <build-dir> --target wllm_native_kernels -j$(nproc)
```

For a gated module:

```bash
cmake -S . -B <build-dir> \
  -DGPU_ARCH=<target_arch> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -D<FEATURE_FLAG>=ON
cmake --build <build-dir> --target <target_module> -j$(nproc)
```

For native C++ model work, also configure the option OFF and confirm the model
producer target is absent; configure target ON with the umbrella OFF and
confirm configuration fails; build every selected hardware target; and on
Linux compare `nm -D --defined-only` against the checked-in C API allowlist.
SM110 builds must not gain an FA2 dependency merely because SM120 uses it.

Import check:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python - <<'PY'
from wllm.native import wllm_native_kernels as fvk
print(fvk.__file__)
PY
```

## 8. Kernel Naming And Long-Term Ownership

Only truly model-agnostic kernels may use generic names. Model-, hardware-, or
shape-specialized kernels must include an ownership prefix in:

- file path
- `.cu/.cuh` file name
- C++ function name
- pybind symbol name
- Python required-symbol list
- docs and tests

Good:

```text
csrc/kernels/<model>/<model>_qk_norm_rope.cu
<model>_qk_norm_rope_bf16

csrc/kernels/<feature>/<feature>_matmul_sm120.cu
<feature>_matmul_sm120_bf16
```

Bad:

```text
csrc/kernels/fused_qk_norm_rope.cu
fused_qk_norm_rope_v4_bf16

csrc/kernels/cfg_combine.cu
cfg_combine_log_softmax_bf16
```

Required:

- No experimental suffixes such as `_v4`, `_new`, or `_fast` in public pybind
  names unless the version is a documented ABI.
- Use hardware or precision suffixes only when they are part of the contract.
- If the kernel is shape-specialized, document the shape constraints and guard
  unsupported shapes before launch.
- Dead or future kernels must not be exported or listed as required.
- If a kernel is exported, the runtime must call it or docs must mark it
  explicitly experimental and not required.

Blockers:

- A model-specific kernel uses a generic name.
- Docs claim a kernel is on the hot path but runtime does not call it.
- Required-symbol tests include unused symbols.
- A symbol is renamed but stale docs/tests still use the old name.
- Shape-specialized code accepts generic shape parameters and can silently
  compute wrong results.

## 9. Pybind ABI And Shape Contracts

Required:

- Every `m.def(...)` argument list must match the C++ launcher signature.
- Pybind names must match Python call sites and required-symbol lists.
- Raw pointer arguments should be typed consistently.
- Shape argument order must be documented when not obvious.
- Backward-compatible aliases must preserve old shape semantics.

Blockers:

- Binding accepts one shape order while caller passes another.
- Binding alias maps an old API to new indexing without proof.
- Device pointer is built from a temporary tensor that can be freed before use.
- `.data_ptr()` is taken from an unanchored tensor and stored for later.
- Binding signature mismatch compiles but fails at runtime.

Minimum tests:

- Import the module.
- Check every required symbol exists.
- Run a small numerical smoke for the new binding where possible.
- Test missing-symbol fail-fast behavior for required kernels.

## 10. Hot Path Cleanliness

The hot path includes forward, decode, CUDA Graph replay, and per-step sampling.

Forbidden in hot path unless explicitly justified:

- `.item()`
- `.cpu()`
- `.numpy()`
- host-to-device scalar readback
- `torch.cuda.synchronize()`
- debug `print()`
- dynamic tensor allocation
- changing Python containers that define capture-time launch order
- heavy imports inside repeated forward
- silent PyTorch fallback for operations claimed to be kernelized

Required:

- CUDA Graph replay must reuse stable buffers and pointers.
- Warmup and capture must execute the same kernel path.
- Prompt, state, or cache changes must invalidate captured state.
- Dynamic shapes must be bucketed, pre-warmed, or rejected clearly.

Blockers:

- Host sync in decode/prefill hot path without a correctness reason.
- Cache is reused across prompt/model-state changes without reset.
- A CUDA Graph captures one branch and replay uses another branch.
- A required kernel is missing and the runtime silently enters PyTorch.

## 11. Model And Hardware Routing

Required:

- Use one semantic pipeline per `(model, framework)` for graph-captured or
  VLA-style runtime paths. Hardware and precision may produce different
  lowered execution plans.
- Hardware targets bind capabilities, layouts and kernels; they do not
  duplicate model math.
- Routing map entries must be explicit.
- Hardware-specific path names should include hardware only for real target
  bindings, packing, private scratch or unsupported capabilities.
- Cross-hardware selection should be capability-driven. Keep architecture names
  out of shared operation bodies.
- Existing routing defaults must not change unless the PR is explicitly a
  routing migration with old-path evidence.
- Plugin or model registration must remain additive and explicit.

Blockers:

- A shared frontend accumulates architecture-name branches instead of selecting
  a target profile or capability.
- Hardware targets duplicate model layer/step loops, stage plans, checkpoint
  mapping or calibration traversal.
- A new path changes default routing for existing models.
- A framework path silently enters another framework's unvalidated route.
- Hardware behavior is selected by guesswork rather than explicit capability.
- A new hardware target reuses an existing frontend without documenting
  unsupported kernels, precision modes, and validation gaps.

## 12. Frontend And Pipeline Ownership

Frontend responsibilities:

- Validate user inputs and config.
- Load checkpoints through declarative specs or documented adapters.
- Own persistent tensors, buffers, scales, and pointer lifetimes.
- Build attention specs and choose hardware backends through documented
  factories.
- Run calibration, warmup, CUDA Graph capture, and fail-fast symbol checks.
- Expose the documented model surface.

Pipeline responsibilities:

- Compose already-owned buffers and weights through kernel calls.
- Keep launch order deterministic for capture.
- Own one readable semantic topology per model; subgraphs are scheduling views
  of that topology, not separate forwards.
- Accept raw pointers, primitive dims, backend handles, streams, and small
  immutable config objects.
- Bind hardware-specific compute through target profiles or model-local target
  helpers. Precision may change the lowered plan, packing and private scratch
  without changing semantic model order.

Pipeline must not:

- Import checkpoint loaders, tokenizers, web/server frameworks, datasets, CLI
  parsers, training loops, or benchmark harnesses.
- Allocate dynamic tensors in repeated forward/decode paths.
- Read host values from device tensors in hot path.
- Hide required kernels behind `hasattr(...)` unless the fallback is a tested
  optional fast path.
- Implement large chunks of model math in PyTorch/JAX after claiming the path
  is kernelized.

Blockers:

- A new model lands as one monolithic file containing IO, weights, calibration,
  graph capture, and hardware-specific forward branches.
- A pipeline imports a dependency that is not needed to launch kernels.
- A frontend stores `.data_ptr()` from a tensor it does not own persistently.

## 13. New Model Acceptance Contract

A new model PR is not complete with only a working script.

Required files or explicit non-applicability:

- Config or documented direct-instantiation path.
- Routing registration for each validated `(config, framework, arch)`.
- One semantic frontend pipeline per `(model, framework)`.
- One explicit target binding/profile per validated hardware and precision;
  multiple lowered execution plans may share the semantic pipeline.
- Weight spec or documented checkpoint adapter.
- Attention spec/backend selection when the model uses attention.
- Calibration/precision spec when FP8, FP4, NVFP4, INT8, or similar is used.
- Model-specific usage docs.
- Focused tests for import/routing, missing symbols, shape guards, and
  first-light correctness against a reference.

Blockers:

- The PR only adds an example script and private local paths.
- The model requires an undocumented checkpoint bundle format.
- The model changes shared kernel names or shared frontend APIs to fit one
  integration.
- First output has no reference comparison or finite-value smoke.

## 14. Precision, Calibration, Cache, And Correctness

Required:

- State dtype and precision mode must be explicit.
- Precision changes must state the reference path.
- Calibration caches must be invalidated when scale semantics change.
- Device scale buffers must be persistent if kernels read them later.
- Quantized paths need cosine, token-match, or domain-specific validation
  against the relevant reference.
- Cache reuse must document exactly what is cached and when it is invalidated.
- Native calibration must replay the production semantic pipeline; targets may
  add observers, packing and private scratch but not another model traversal.
- Artifact identity must cover checkpoint/tokenizer digests, target and dtype,
  plus every shape-affecting setup field.
- VLA calibration changes need configured single-view and multi-view coverage,
  repeated observations, deterministic reduction and final runtime-open proof.

Blockers:

- Activation scale writer and reader use different keys.
- Refit or packing updates one weight representation but hot graph reads
  another.
- Prompt/state changes do not reset temporal or KV cache state.
- Speed is reported without correctness.
- Low correctness is accepted without comparing to the right reference noise
  floor.
- Dataset iteration or sample-selection policy is embedded in runtime, Nexus or
  a hardware target.

Minimum correctness evidence:

- VLA actions: action cosine or max error vs reference, plus task smoke.
- LLM/VLM: logits cosine, argmax match, or short generation sanity.
- TTS/audio: mel cosine, token match where applicable, subjective notes only as
  secondary evidence.
- Diffusion/video: latent cosine, output smoke, and finite checks.
- Kernel only: numerical unit test vs PyTorch or NumPy reference.

## 15. Tests

At least one relevant test class should exist for every non-doc PR:

- Import smoke test.
- Missing-symbol fail-fast test.
- Shape guard test.
- Config/routing guard test.
- Numerical unit test for new kernels or quantizers.
- Backward compatibility test for API changes.
- Build/import test for dedicated modules where possible.

Tests must not:

- Depend on private paths.
- Insert absolute local bundle paths by default.
- Require multi-GB checkpoints unless marked as local smoke scripts, not CI.
- Assert APIs that implementation does not expose.
- Pass by catching all exceptions without checking the message.
- Skip everything in the default environment without testing import/fail-fast.
- Depend on test ordering or global CUDA state from another test.
- Use network downloads in default tests.

Commands:

```bash
python -m compileall <changed_python_files>
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q <focused_tests>
```

## 16. Documentation

Required:

- Public user-facing behavior must be documented.
- Build flags must match CMake exactly.
- Import paths must match implementation.
- Kernel/module ownership must match CMake.
- New model docs must state supported `(framework, hardware, precision)` tuples
  and unsupported combinations.
- New hardware docs must state exact GPU/SM, toolkit assumptions, build flags,
  and validation status.
- New precision docs must state scale granularity, cache key semantics,
  reference path, and invalidation rules.
- Performance tables must state hardware, toolkit, checkpoint, precision,
  shape, and metric definition.
- Docs must distinguish wall-clock latency from replay-only latency.
- Experimental modes must be labeled as experimental.

Blockers:

- Docs tell users to import a non-existent API.
- Docs mention stale kernels that were removed.
- Docs claim fallback behavior but implementation fail-fasts, or the reverse.
- Docs show private paths, hostnames, local usernames, or internal checkpoint
  locations.
- Benchmark claims have no command or reproducibility note.
- Docs say a feature is default when it is gated, or gated when it is default.

## 17. Privacy And Repository Hygiene

Run a diff-scoped scan. Avoid broad scans that report unrelated existing files.

```bash
changed="$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD)"

rg -n "<absolute-local-path>|<internal-host>|ssh://|private-path|private-host" $changed
rg -n "secret|password|apikey|api_key|access_token|auth_token|bearer |ChatGPT|Claude|Co-authored-by:|Generated by|pdb|breakpoint|TODO|FIXME|XXX" $changed
```

Not every hit is a blocker:

- Placeholder paths such as `<path-to-checkpoint>` are fine.
- `127.0.0.1` in server docs is fine.
- `TODO` is only a blocker if it is introduced in maintained code without a
  tracked plan.

Blockers:

- Real private paths.
- Secrets or tokens.
- Internal hostnames.
- Local usernames.
- AI-generated traces or comments.
- Debug print in library code.
- Temporary benchmark output, local notebooks, or cache files.

## 18. Performance Claims

Required:

- State the exact command.
- State hardware, toolkit, driver if relevant, checkpoint, precision, shape,
  batch, sequence length, warmup count, and iteration count.
- Compare against the correct baseline.
- Report correctness alongside speed.

Blockers:

- Speedup claim without correctness.
- Comparing replay-only latency to wall-clock baseline.
- Using different prompt/image/shape between baseline and optimized path.
- Reporting a cherry-picked median without iteration count or distribution.
- Claiming a kernel is used while runtime still calls PyTorch for that op.

## 19. Serving And Execution Contract

Required:

- `exec/` stays mechanism-only.
- Serving policy stays in `serving/` or user hosts.
- GPU/model state remains owned by frontend/pipeline.
- Serving may own request metadata, sessions, protocol, and serialization.
- Server-only dependencies must be optional and documented.

Blockers:

- Server dependencies are imported by core `wllm_native` on import.
- Protocol/session/cache policy is added to `exec/`.
- Serving example mutates model internals without using a documented model API.

## 20. Future Hardware And Platform Readiness

Required:

- Keep generic runtime names vendor-neutral unless the API is truly vendor-only.
- Vendor-specific code belongs under explicit hardware/backend paths, CMake
  flags, or dedicated modules.
- Do not put vendor-only assumptions into model-independent Python APIs unless
  the API name or docs say so.
- Hardware capability checks must be explicit and fail fast.
- Platform-specific build behavior must be isolated in CMake or platform docs.
- Future backend placeholders are acceptable only in docs or disabled stubs
  that raise clear "not implemented" errors.

Blockers:

- A generic module depends on vendor-specific headers, compiler flags, shared
  libraries, or Python packages without a gate.
- A hardware abstraction is widened by adding vendor-specific optional
  parameters to common APIs.
- Unsupported hardware silently falls back to a slower or numerically different
  path.
- Platform-specific shell commands or library names are baked into public docs
  without alternatives.

## 22. Reviewer Comment Template

Use this shape for PR comments:

```markdown
Review result: <Accept / Request changes / Blocker / Needs hardware validation>.
Risk class: <R0/R1/R2/R3/R4>.

Before merge, these items need to be fixed:

- [ ] <blocking item with file/symbol and why it matters>
- [ ] <expected fix>
- [ ] <doc/test/build item>

What I verified:

- `<command>`: passed
- `<command>`: failed with <short reason>

Hardware or fixtures I could not validate:

- <target or fixture>: <reason>
```

Avoid vague comments such as "please make it cleaner". Name the file, symbol,
expected behavior, and whether the item blocks merge.

## 23. Follow-Up Versus Blocking

Usually acceptable as follow-up:

- Wider hardware benchmark when structure is isolated and target hardware has
  contributor or CI evidence.
- Extra performance tuning after correctness passes.
- More polished docs when existing docs are accurate enough to run.
- Renaming non-public internal helper variables.
- Consolidating similar model-specific helpers after both are correct.
- Adding another hardware/framework tuple not claimed by the PR.

Must block:

- Failing tests in the default environment.
- Import failure for `wllm_native`.
- Undefined or duplicate symbols.
- Wrong public docs.
- Wrong API path in docs/tests.
- Host sync in claimed hot path.
- Private paths or secrets.
- Unvalidated route for an existing hardware path.
- Incorrect precision/cache behavior.
- New default behavior without old-path evidence.
- New dependency leaking into core import or default install.
- New model path without routing/import/correctness evidence.
- Kernel names, paths, or pybind symbols that hide model/hardware ownership.
- `exec/` or common runtime changes that include scenario policy.
